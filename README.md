## Framework Overview
![architecture](Fig/Fig_Method7_01.png)
This paper introduces the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC) framework, which enhances medical decision-making by dynamically selecting and integrating multiple specialized large language models (LLMs). The framework features an expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy, which evaluates the strengths of various LLMs across medical domains, and a confidence- and adversarial-driven collaboration mechanism, refining the responses through iterative validation. These contributions improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability, offering a robust solution for AI-assisted medical decision support systems.
